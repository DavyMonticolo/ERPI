## Creative Problem Solving, starting from scratch

Most of the time, innovation starts with a fuzzy idea that has to be grown and fed.

To facilitate this maturing phase, we will present existing tools and methods that allow to find out different variants of this idea, using paths made of twists and turns, divergent and convergent reasonings, as well as systematic fantasy. Thus, the idea becomes a concept portfolio from which you just have to pick up the ones with higher development potential.If you enjoy playing with ideas, stretching, flipping and finally shaping them… You will enjoy this training experience.

## Prototyping your Ideas

Based on the FabLab approach, we will present you the importance of making an ‘Intermediary object’ in the innovation project development.

Materialize an idea allows people to confront in the first hand with the reality. This creates a shared language among stakeholders.
Having the feedback as early as possible in the design process is a key driver to mature an innovative concept.
And also, this establish the first step in order evolve the idea, considering the perspectives of the different actors in the project.


## Technology Management: adapting your innovation ecosystem 



## User experience and Product acceptability: user centered approaches

Developing more accepted products by integrating stakeholder preferences is a challenge for designers.

This leads designers to verify and validate the relevance of product requirements throughout the design cycle. The acceptance or rejection of a product is also linked to several physical, cognitive, emotional and social factors of the individual and the environment in which it is used. However, user participation is still limited to the early design phases. Some design approaches such as User Centered Design (UCD), User Experience Design (UX) and other co-design approaches promote better user participation throughout the design cycle and better consideration of other aspects related to usage. 

In this course we will introduce different tools to check if the proposed solution concept generates the desired experience in potential users. Participants will be required to apply the tools presented on a design project throughout the course. For this purpose, the tools available on the LorraineFabLivingLab® will be at their disposal.
