## The creation of a local plastic recycling network for 3D printing will open up new opportunities for the circular economy.

The Green Fablab concept is linked to the growth of several societal trends such as the growing interest in 3D printing, the development of open innovation spaces (e.g. fablabs, living labs) and the growing awareness of protecting the environment and supporting sustainable development. 
Today, the creation of a local recycling network is one of the major ways to formalize a distributed approach to the reuse of plastic materials. The integration of these recycled materials into these co-creation spaces makes it possible to consider these wastes as deposits and transform them into "new raw materials". The Green FabLab concept is therefore based on the principles of the circular and collaborative economy, a model that is now essential to meet the Company's current challenges.
